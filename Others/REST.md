### What is REST?

REST (Representational State transfer) is an architectural style for developing web services which exploit the ubiquity of HTTP protocol and uses HTTP method to define actions. It revolves around resource where every component being a resource that can be accessed through a shared interface using standard HTTP methods.

In REST architecture, a REST Server provides access to resources and REST client accesses and makes these resources available. Here, each resource is identified by URIs or global IDs, and REST uses multiple ways to represent a resource, such as text, JSON, and XML. XML and JSON are nowadays the most popular representations of resources.

### What is a RESTful Web Services?

Mostly, there are two kinds of Web Services:

* **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):** an XML-based method to expose web services.

* **RESTful web services:** Web Services developed in the REST style are referred to as RESTful web services. These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI, Uniform Resource identifier a serivce, provides resource representation like JSON and a set of HTTP methods.
